# Revisit Design Patterns

## Learning Goals

- Revisit Design Patterns.
- Explain Creational and Structural Patterns.

## Introduction

In the last module, we introduced the topic of design patterns. As a refresher,
design patterns provide specific solutions for specific problems. We learned
about the singleton design pattern and how it is a creational design pattern
that ensures only one instance of the class exists within a system to provide a
global access point. Let us now delve into some more design patterns now that
we have learned a little more about Java!

## Creational Design Patterns

**Creational patterns** are patterns that aim to abstract how objects are
created to allow clients to use different implementations of interfaces without
having to be aware of each specific implementation. These type of patterns that
focus on the way objects are created will reduce complexities and increase
flexibility.

We should also note that when we use the term "client", we are referring to
any entity that requests services from another entity.

We have already seen one creational design pattern, and that is the use of the
singleton design pattern we learned about in the last module. In this module,
we will cover one more creational design pattern before learning more about
some structural patterns.

## Structural Design Patterns

**Structural patterns** are patterns that help deal with the complexity that
comes with large systems. These patterns provide us different ways to combine
multiple classes together to implement functionality that takes advantage of
each class without binding us to a tightly coupled relationship between those
classes.

In short, structural design patterns help us build objects and classes into
larger structures without losing efficiency or flexibility.
